\begin_layout Section
Pure Exchange Equilibrium
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two consumers: 1 and 2; two goods: 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

; initial total endowments: 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{e}_{x}=10$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{e}_{y}=8$
\end_inset

; and no production.
 Note that in this model there appears to be four endogeneous variables
 which denote the allocation of the two goods: 
\begin_inset Formula $[x_{1},y_{1},x_{2},y_{2}]$
\end_inset

 and one endogeneous price variable which allows the markets to clear: 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 However, in reality, because the total endowment is fixed at the outset,
 it must be the case that: 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}+x_{2}=\bar{e}_{x}=10$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}+y_{2}=\bar{e}_{y}=8$
\end_inset

.
 So in reality, we're only dealing with, at most, three endogeneous variables.

status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is a very important concept and provides much of the intuition behind
 general equilibrium, so make sure that you're comfortable with it.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This model can be depicted using the Edgeworth Box.
 Draw the line depicting the number of units of good 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 on the horizontal axis and the number of units of good 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 on the vertical axis.
 Note that points within the box are both feasible: 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}+x_{2}\leq\bar{e}_{x}=10$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}+y_{2}\leq\bar{e}_{y}=8$
\end_inset

, and non-wasteful: 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}+x_{2}=\bar{e}_{x}=10$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}+y_{2}=\bar{e}_{y}=8$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Figure 1, we see an exchange equilibrium where the price vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{p}=[p_{x},p_{y}]$
\end_inset

 clears the markets for both good x and good y.
 The allocation 
\begin_inset Formula $[\vec{x}^{*},\vec{y}^{*}]$
\end_inset

 is a Pareto Optimal allocation (since the indifference curves of Consumer
 1 and 2 are tangent to each other) and the allocation 
\begin_inset Formula $[\vec{x}^{*},\vec{y}^{*}]$
\end_inset

 is on a higher indifference curve for both Consumers than those which pass
 through the initial endowment, 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{e}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Figure 2, we see an instance where the price vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{p}=[p_{x},p_{y}]$
\end_inset

 does not clear the markets for both good x and good y; there is excess
 demand for good 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and excess supply for good 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The difference between the two figures arises from the UMPs that each consumer
 is solving.
 In each figure, Consumer 1 and 2 are choosing their optimal bundle such
 that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\partial u_{i}(x_{i}^{*},y_{i}^{*})/\partial x}{\partial u_{i}(x_{i}^{*},y_{i}^{*})/\partial y}=\frac{p_{x}}{p_{y}}\,\forall i\in\left\{ 1,2\right\} .\]

\end_inset

However, in the scenario depicted in Figure 2, the following Pareto condition
 does not hold:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\partial u_{1}(x_{1i}^{*},y_{1}^{*})/\partial x}{\partial u_{1}(x_{1}^{*},y_{1}^{*})/\partial y}\neq\frac{\partial u_{2}(x_{2}^{*},y_{2}^{*})/\partial x}{\partial u_{2}(x_{2}^{*},y_{2}^{*})/\partial y}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Exchange/Walrasian Equilibrium
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The exchange equilibrium we are looking for can be thought of as follows:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Given an endowment, 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{e}$
\end_inset

, rotate the budget line through such endowment.
 This rotation can be thought of as changing the relative prices of good
 x and good y since the slope of the budget line is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $-\frac{p_{x}}{p_{y}}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that here we need to assume that prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{x}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{y}\in(0,\infty)$
\end_inset

.
 See MWG ch 15.B, Figure 15.B.5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Then for each relative price ratio (slope of the budget line), solve the
 UMP for Consumer 1, which will result in the offer curve.
 The offer curve can be thought of as the solutions to the Consumer 1's
 UMP, which are functions (or correspondences) of the relative price ratio,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{p_{x}}{p_{y}}$
\end_inset

.
 Do the same for Consumer 2.
 Equilibrium candidates are at the intersection of the offer curves.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \[
\max_{x_{i},y_{i}}u_{i}(x_{i},y_{i})\, s.t.\, p_{x}x_{i}+p_{y}y_{i}\leq p_{x}e_{xi}+p_{y}e_{yi}\,\forall i\in\left\{ 1,2\right\} \]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Given these candidates, we need to check to see if there exists a price
 ratio, given the initial endowment, that will clear the markets for one
 of the goods (if one of the markets clear, the other will also clear since
 both Consumer 1 and Consumer 2's demanded bundles lie on the budget line).
 In short, we need to check whether either:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{1}^{*}+x_{2}^{*}=e_{x1}+e_{x2},\]

\end_inset

or 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \[
y_{1}^{*}+y_{2}^{*}=e_{y1}+e_{y2}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another issue that economists have grappled with is the existence of exchange
 equilibria.
 A comprehensive review of this material is well beyond the scope of Ec
 2020a, but for those interested see MWG ch 17.C and 17.D.
 Suffice it to say that a Walrasian equilibrium exists in a pure exchange
 economy in which 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\omega}=[\omega_{1}...\omega_{L}]\gg0$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{l}=\sum_{i}\omega_{li}$
\end_inset

, and each consumer has continuous, strictly convex, and strongly monotone
 preferences.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Examples
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}(x_{1},y_{1})=x_{1}^{\frac{1}{2}}y_{1}^{\frac{1}{2}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{2}(x_{2},y_{2})=x_{2}^{\frac{1}{2}}y_{2}^{\frac{1}{2}}$
\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{x1}=8,\, e_{x2}=2,\, e_{y1}=2,\, e_{y2}=6$
\end_inset

; and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{p}=[1,p]$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Prices have been normalized.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Solve for the exchange equilibrium allocation and the equilibrium price.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consumer 1's UMP is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\max_{x_{1},y_{1}}x_{1}^{\frac{1}{2}}y_{1}^{\frac{1}{2}}\, s.t.\, x_{1}+py_{1}\leq e_{x1}+pe_{y1}=8+2p\]

\end_inset

which has the following solutions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
x_{1}^{*}(p) & = & \frac{8+2p}{2}=4+p\label{eq:1}\\
y_{1}^{*}(p) & = & \frac{8+2p}{2p}=\frac{4}{p}+1.\label{eq:2}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consumer 2's UMP yields the following solutions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
x_{2}^{*}(p) & = & \frac{e_{x2}+pe_{y2}}{2}=\frac{2+6p}{2}=1+3p\label{eq:3}\\
y_{2}^{*}(p) & = & \frac{e_{x2}+pe_{y2}}{2p}=\frac{2+6p}{2p}=\frac{1}{p}+3.\label{eq:4}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now have to determine the 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{*}$
\end_inset

such that markets will clear.
 Note that the price ratio for this problem, as in many problems you will
 come across in Econ 2020a, is equal to the inverse of the price of good
 y because we normalized the price of one good to equal 1.
 If we don't normalize the price of good 1, we would be solving for 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{p_{x}}{p_{y}}$
\end_inset

 and we wouldn't be able to solve for 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{y}$
\end_inset

 separately.
 In short, the exchange equilibrium allows us to pin down the price ratio,
 but not the exact prices of good x and good y.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's use good 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 to solve for 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{*}$
\end_inset

 since it has the easier equations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
x_{1}^{*}(p)+x_{2}^{*}(p) & = & 5+4p^{*}=e_{x1}+e_{x2}=10\\
\therefore p^{*} & = & \frac{5}{4}.\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

If we plug the equilibrium price ratio into equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq5"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq7"

\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq8"

\end_inset

, we can solve for the equilibrium allocation 
\begin_inset Formula $[\vec{x}^{*},\vec{y}^{*}]$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}(x_{1},y_{1})=x_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{2}(x_{2},y_{2})=x_{2}^{\frac{1}{2}}y_{2}^{\frac{1}{2}}$
\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{x1}=10,\, e_{x2}=0,\, e_{y1}=0,\, e_{y2}=8$
\end_inset

; and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{p}=[1,p]$
\end_inset

.
 Solve for the exchange equilibrium allocation and the equilibrium price.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consumer 1's UMP is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\max_{x_{1}}x_{1}\, s.t.\, x_{1}+py_{1}\leq e_{x1}+pe_{y1}=10\]

\end_inset

which has the following border solutions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
x_{1}^{*}(p) & = & 10\label{eq5}\\
y_{1}^{*}(p) & = & 0.\label{eq6}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consumer 2's UMP yields the following solutions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
x_{2}^{*}(p) & = & \frac{e_{x2}+pe_{y2}}{2}=\frac{8p}{2}=4p\label{eq7}\\
y_{2}^{*}(p) & = & \frac{e_{x2}+pe_{y2}}{2p}=\frac{8p}{2p}=4.\label{eq8}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Markets clear for good 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $10+4p=10$
\end_inset

, therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{*}=0$
\end_inset

, which is intuitive since Consumer 2 is supplying good 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, but Consumer 1 doesn't demand good 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 At 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{*}=0$
\end_inset

, we have multiple equilibria.
 See Edgeworth Box at the end of the section notes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
Consumers 1 and 2; goods 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

; Let 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x_{1},y_{1})=\min\left\{ x_{1}^{2}y_{1},300\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v(x_{2},y_{2})=x_{2}y_{2}^{2}$
\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{e}_{x}=\bar{e}_{y}=12$
\end_inset

; and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{p}=[1,p]$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example

\series bold
Part a)
\series default
 
\shape italic
Explain how you would identify the set of Pareto Optimal allocations for
 this economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
Recall that the set of Pareto Optimal allocations could be written as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
\begin_inset Formula \[
S\equiv\left\{ \left(\vec{x},\vec{y}\right)|MRS_{x_{1}y_{1}}=MRS_{x_{2}y_{2}}\right\} .\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
For Consumer 1, the marginal utilities are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_{1}}\begin{cases}
2x_{1}y_{1} & if\, x_{1}^{2}y_{1}<300\\
0 & otherwise\end{cases}\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y_{1}}\begin{cases}
x_{1}^{2} & if\, x_{1}^{2}y_{1}<300\\
0 & otherwise\end{cases}\]

\end_inset

therefore if 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}^{2}y_{1}\geq300$
\end_inset

, then the marginal rate of subsitution is undefined and if 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}^{2}y_{1}<300$
\end_inset

, the marginal rate of substitution can be written as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_{1}}}{\frac{\partial u}{\partial y_{1}}}=\frac{2y_{1}}{x_{1}}.\label{eq:8}\end{equation}

\end_inset

For Consumer 2, the marginal utilities are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_{2}} & = & y_{2}^{2}\\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y_{2}} & = & 2x_{2}y_{2}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

so that the marginal rate of subsitution is equal to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_{2}}}{\frac{\partial u}{\partial y_{2}}}=\frac{y_{2}}{2x_{2}}.\label{eq:9}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Therefore, for values of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1},\, y_{1}$
\end_inset

 s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}^{2}y_{1}<300$
\end_inset

, we set equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:8"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:9"

\end_inset

 equal to each other noting that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}+x_{2}=12$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}+y_{2}=12$
\end_inset

 because the total endowment for both goods is equal to 12.
 Then we get the following for 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1},y_{1}$
\end_inset

 s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}^{2}y_{1}<300$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{2y_{1}}{x_{1}}=\frac{y_{2}}{2x_{2}}\Rightarrow\frac{2y_{1}}{x_{1}}=\frac{12-y_{1}}{2(12-x_{1})}\Rightarrow y_{1}=\frac{4x_{1}}{16-x_{1}}\label{eq:10}\end{equation}

\end_inset

, which defines the set of Pareto Optimal allocations.
 See end of the section notes for the graphical representation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example

\series bold
Part b)
\series default
 
\shape italic
Consider the initial endowment of (8,4) for Consumer 1.
 Normalize 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{x}=1$
\end_inset

.
 What price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{y}$
\end_inset

, if any, will sustain this allocation as an exchange equilibrium? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
First note that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}^{2}y_{1}=256<300$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
The key to this question is to see that for the initial allocation to be
 an exchange equilibrium, it must be the case that it is Pareto Optimal
 (in the sense that you cannot make one consumer better off without making
 the other worse off, or equivalently, there can be no gains from trade).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
From 
\series bold
part a)
\series default
 above, we have the conditions for Pareto optimality in equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:10"

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, the marginal rates of substitutions for both consumers must
 equal the price ratio:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{2y_{1}}{x_{1}}=\frac{y_{2}}{2x_{2}}=\frac{1}{p_{y}}\Rightarrow p_{y}^{*}=1\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Example

\series bold
Part c)
\series default
 
\shape italic
Repeat part b) above, but with the initial endowment of Consumer 1 equal
 to (10,5) (which means that the Consumer 2's endowment is equal to (2,7)).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}^{2}y_{1}=500>300$
\end_inset

, which means that the MRS of Consumer 1 is not defined.
 Intuitively, Consumer 1 is indifferent between any consumption bundle 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{1},y_{1})$
\end_inset

 s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}^{2}y_{1}>300$
\end_inset

 and so depending on the assumptions that you make on the behavior of Consumer
 1 when indifferent between consumption bundles, a price ratio may or may
 not exist, or there may be multiple price ratios that allow for gains from
 trade.
