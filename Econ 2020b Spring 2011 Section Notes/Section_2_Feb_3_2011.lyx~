Price Discrimination and Monopoly
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Types of price discrimination
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This taxonomy isn't really helpful in understanding price discrimination,
 but almost all of the text books have it.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
First Degree Price Discrimination: Monopolist observes the type of the consumer
 and is able to calculate each consumer's demand correspondences (or their
 willingness to pay).
 The monopolist uses this to charge each individual his or her willingness
 to pay.
 AKA perfect price discrimination or individual pricing.
 Generally, the first-best (FB) outcome can be implemented because with
 perfect price discrimination there may not be any DWL.
 Note that the monopolist seller gets all of the surplus.
 See Figure 3.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Second Degree Price Discrimination: Monopolist is unable to observe the
 types of each consumer, and so proposes a menu of prices and quantities.
 Consumers self-select themselves into their optimal quantity and price,
 which can be derived using the Revelation Principle (see MWG 14.C.2 for more
 information).
 Screening models.
 Ex) Intel's 486 DX and SX, and 487 micro processors, where SX is just a
 damaged version of the DX, and 487 was an upgrade of the SX to the DX.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Third Degree Price Discrimination: Monopolist is uable to observe types,
 but is able to observe something immutable that is related to a consumer's
 willingness to pay.
 Monopolist charges based on this characteristic.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Basic Monopolist's Problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that a producer/seller of goods in a competitive market must solve
 its profit maximization problem which can be written as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\max_{q}pq-c(q)\Rightarrow p=c'(q^{C}),\]

\end_inset

or the price (which is exogeneous) is equal to the marginal cost.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The monopolist's problem is slightly different:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that we use the inverse demand function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 in the objective function.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\max_{q}p(q)q-c(q)\Rightarrow p(q^{M})+p'(q^{M})q^{M}=c'(q^{M})\label{eq:monopolist problem}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the LHS of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:monopolist problem"

\end_inset

 is the marginal revenue 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\frac{d\left[p(q)q\right]}{dq}\right)$
\end_inset

of the monopolist and the RHS is the marginal cost.
 We see that 
\begin_inset Formula $p(q^{M})>c'(q^{M})$
\end_inset

 because 
\begin_inset Formula $p'(\cdot)<0$
\end_inset

, which means that the price under a monopoly exceeds the marginal cost
 of production.
 This in turn means that 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{M}<q^{C}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Harvard Football Example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume that the good of interest is The Game football tickets, which are
 being supplied by a monopolistic seller with cost function equal to: 
\begin_inset Formula $c(Q)=\frac{Q^{2}}{20}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is the total number of tickets supplied to the market, including both those
 supplied to alumni and to students: 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=q_{a}+q_{s}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further assume that there are two types of consumers: alumni and students.
 The demand function for alumni can be written as: 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{a}(p_{a})=100-p_{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{s}(p_{s})=200-10p_{s}$
\end_inset

.
 The monopolist has information on whether a consumer is a student or an
 alumni and so is able to engage in Third Degree Price Discrimination.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
No Students
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we assume that students are in reading period and unable to attend, the
 monopolist's problems is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\max_{q_{a}=Q}\left\{ p_{a}(Q)\cdot Q-c(Q)\right\} =\max_{Q}\left\{ (100-Q)\cdot Q-\frac{Q^{2}}{20}\right\} \label{eq:example monopolist problem no stud}\end{equation}

\end_inset

the FOCs are (assuming an interior solution):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
100-2Q-\frac{Q}{10}=0\Rightarrow Q^{*}=q_{a}^{*}\approx47.6\]

\end_inset

and the resulting optimal price and profit are: 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{a}^{*}\approx52.4$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{npd}^{*}=q_{a}^{*}\cdot p_{a}^{*}-c(q_{a}^{*})\approx2381.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Third Degree Price Discrimination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now the monopolist solves the following problem:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\max_{q_{a},q_{s}}\left\{ p_{a}(q_{a})\cdot q_{a}+p_{s}(q_{s})\cdot q_{s}-c(q_{a}+q_{s})\right\}  & \Rightarrow\\
\max_{q_{a},q_{s}}\left\{ \left(100-q_{a}\right)\cdot q_{a}+\left(20-\frac{q_{s}}{10}\right)\cdot q_{s}-\frac{\left(q_{a}+q_{s}\right)^{2}}{20}\right\} \end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

which has the following FOCs:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
100-2q_{a} & = & \frac{\left(q_{a}+q_{s}\right)}{10}\label{eq:1}\\
20-\frac{q_{s}}{5} & = & \frac{\left(q_{a}+q_{s}\right)}{10}\label{eq:2}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Solving the system of linear equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:1"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:2"

\end_inset

 results in 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{a}^{*}\approx45.2$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{a}^{*}\approx54.8$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{s}^{*}\approx51.6$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{s}^{*}\approx14.84$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{pd}^{*}=q_{a}^{*}\cdot p_{a}^{*}+q_{s}^{*}\cdot p_{s}^{*}-c(q_{a}^{*}+q_{s}^{*})\approx2774>\pi_{npd}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How much is produced (sold) when only alumni are sold to? How much is produced
 (sold) when the monopolist seller is able to price discriminate? Intuition?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Monopolistic Seller and Two-Type Buyer
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that some of this will be revisited in the context of adverse selection.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As noted above, second degree price discrimination involves the monopolistic
 seller offering a menu of price and quantity contracts.
 The following is a simple abstract model of second degree price discrimination.
 See also the Miller Notes on Monopoly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a setting where there is a monopolistic seller and a buyer who
 is of two types (a high value type or a low value type and we use the subscript
 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in\left\{ L,H\right\} $
\end_inset

 to denote each type).
 The probability of a low-type is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 Assume that the price charged by the monopolist is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 and the quantity produced/sold is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

.
 The monopolist has a linear cost function equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $c\cdot q$
\end_inset

.
 The buyer who is of type 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 has separable utility of the following form: 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{i}u(q)-T$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a parameter denoting the relative utility the buyer gets from consuming
 the monopolist's good.
 Assume further that the reservation utility of the buyer is normalized
 to equal zero (0)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
First Degree Price Discrimination (First-Best)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume that the seller is able to perfectly observe the type of the buyer.
 The result is that the seller doesn't need to offer a menu of price and
 quantity contracts, but can simply make a take-it-or-leave-it one price
 and quantity contract offer to the buyer.
 What is the monopolist's constrained optimization problem?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\max_{T_{i},q_{i}}\left[T_{i}-cq_{i}\right]\, s.t.\,\theta_{i}u(q_{i})-T_{i}\geq0\]

\end_inset

which becomes the following unconstrained optimization problem:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\max_{T_{i},q_{i}}\left[\theta_{i}u(q_{i})-cq_{i}\right]\]

\end_inset

The FOCs result in the optimal quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{FB}$
\end_inset

 such that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\theta_{H}u'\left(q_{H}^{FB}\right) & = & c\\
\theta_{L}u'\left(q_{L}^{FB}\right) & = & c\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

In conclusion, the monopolist seller who know the buyer's type 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 will make a take-it-or-leave-it offer of:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[T_{i}=\theta_{i}u\left(q_{i}^{FB}\right),\, q_{i}^{FB}\right]\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Second Degree Price Discrimination (Second-Best)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It should be noted that the contract menu below is not the only viable contract.
 Contracts with linear prices and/or a simple two-part tariff are all possible
 contracts that the monopolistic seller can use.
 However, the contract which maximizes the seller's profits is as discussed
 below.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For second degree price discrimination, we assume that the seller is unable
 to perfectly observe the type of the buyer.
 However, she does know the ex ante distribution of types, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pr(\theta_{i}=\theta_{L})=\beta$
\end_inset

.
 Assuming that monopolist is able to offer a menu of price/quantity contracts
 and that the buyers will self-select into the optimal contract, we can
 write the seller's constrained maximization problem as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\max_{\left[T_{H},T_{L},q_{H},q_{L}\right]}\left[\beta\left(T_{L}-cq_{L}\right)+\left(1-\beta\right)\left(T_{H}-cq_{H}\right)\right]\, s.t.\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\theta_{H}u(q_{H})-T_{H} & \geq & \theta_{H}u(q_{L})-T_{L}\,\,\,(IC_{H})\\
\theta_{L}u(q_{L})-T_{L} & \geq & \theta_{L}u(q_{H})-T_{H}\,\,\,(IC_{L})\\
\theta_{H}u(q_{H})-T_{H} & \geq & 0\,\,\,(IR_{H})\\
\theta_{L}u(q_{L})-T_{L} & \geq & 0\,\,\,(IR_{L})\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
Of the four constraints, the 
\begin_inset Formula $IC_{H}$
\end_inset

 and the 
\begin_inset Formula $IR_{L}$
\end_inset

 are the only two constraints that will bind.
 The remaining two constraints will remain slack at the optimum.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'll skip the proof of the proposition.
 But a good rule of thumb to have is that the the incentive compatibility
 constraint of the type who wants to act like the other type will bind while
 his individual rationality constraint is slack.
 On the other hand, the individual rationality constraint of the type that
 does not have an incentive to act like the other type will bind while his
 incentive compatibility constraint will be slack.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result of Proposition 1 above is that the constrained optimization problem
 above can be rewritten as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\max_{\left[T_{H},T_{L},q_{H},q_{L}\right]}\left[\beta\left(T_{L}-cq_{L}\right)+\left(1-\beta\right)\left(T_{H}-cq_{H}\right)\right]\, s.t.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\theta_{H}u(q_{H})-T_{H} & = & \theta_{H}u(q_{L})-T_{L}\\
\theta_{L}u(q_{L})-T_{L} & = & 0\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

which in turn can be written as the following unconstrained optimization
 problem:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\max_{\left[T_{H},T_{L},q_{H},q_{L}\right]}\left[\beta\left(\theta_{L}u(q_{L})-cq_{L}\right)+\left(1-\beta\right)\left(\theta_{H}u(q_{H})-cq_{H}-\left(\theta_{H}-\theta_{L}\right)u(q_{L})\right)\right]\]

\end_inset

The FOCs are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\theta_{H}u'\left(q_{H}^{SB}\right) & = & c\\
\theta_{L}u'\left(q_{L}^{SB}\right) & = & \frac{c}{1-\left(\frac{1-\beta}{\beta}\cdot\frac{\theta_{H}-\theta_{L}}{\theta_{L}}\right)}>c\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

which implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{H}^{FB}=q_{H}^{SB}>q_{L}^{SB}$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{L}^{FB}>q_{L}^{SB}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, with optimal second degree price discrimination:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
High types consume the same as in the first best optimal quantity, but the
 low type's consumption is distorted to less than the optimal level of consumpti
on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The low type's consumer surplus is equal to zero (which must be the case,
 since his IR constraint binds with equality), while the high type receives
 an informational rent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Bertrand vs.
 Cournot Duopoly 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
In the Bertrand Duopoly model, there is a unique Nash Equilibrium (
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{*},\, p_{2}^{*})$
\end_inset

, where the two identical firms set their prices equal to the marginal cost
 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Both firms earn zero profits.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Since price is equal to marginal cost, we get the perfectly competitive
 outcome with only two firms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Because of Bertrand competition, each firm faces infinitely elastic demand
 correspondences given the price of the other firm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Therefore, monopoly is the only form of price distortion that can arise.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
In the Cournot Duopoly model where per unit cost 
\begin_inset Formula $c>0$
\end_inset

 for both firms and the inverse demand function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(q)$
\end_inset

 is such that 
\begin_inset Formula $p'(q)<0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(0)>c$
\end_inset

; any Nash Equilibrium 
\begin_inset Formula $(q_{1}^{*},q_{2}^{*})$
\end_inset

 will result in market prices greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 and smaller than the monopoly price.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Firms earn positive profits and we are not in a perfectly competitive equilibriu
m.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Oligopolies arise under the Cournot model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's look at an example with linear inverse demand functions and constant
 marginal costs.
 Assume that both firms have marginal costs equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

, and the inverse demand function is linear: 
\begin_inset Formula $P(Q)=\alpha-Q$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=q_{1}+q_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Further assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha>c$
\end_inset

.
 The profit function for each firm can be written as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\pi_{1}(q_{1};q_{2}) & = & q_{1}P(q_{1}+q_{2})-cq_{1}=(\alpha-c-q_{2})q_{1}-q_{1}^{2}\\
\pi_{2}(q_{2};q_{1}) & = & q_{2}P(q_{1}+q_{2})-cq_{2}=(\alpha-c-q_{1})q_{2}-q_{2}^{2}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

We can derive the best response functions for each firm by using the FOCs
 of each firms' profit maximization problem.
 Therefore, the best response function for firm 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is:
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that the profit functions for both firms are symmetric.
 This means that the FOCs will be symmetric leading to symmetric best response
 functions.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
q_{i}=b_{i}(q_{j})=\frac{\alpha-c-q_{j}}{2}\end{equation}

\end_inset

By the definition of Nash Equilibrium, we know that the following two equations
 must hold at 
\begin_inset Formula $(q_{1}^{*},q_{2}^{*})$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
q_{1}^{*} & = & \frac{\alpha-c-q_{2}^{*}}{2}\\
q_{2}^{*} & = & \frac{\alpha-c-q_{1}^{*}}{2}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Solving the two equations above defines the Nash Equilibrium:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
(q_{1}^{*},q_{2}^{*})=\left(\frac{\alpha-c}{3},\frac{\alpha-c}{3}\right)\label{eq:Cournot equ}\end{equation}

\end_inset

which results in total output 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{Cournot}=\frac{2}{3}\cdot(\alpha-c)$
\end_inset

 and equilibrium price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{Cournot}=P\left(\frac{2}{3}\cdot(\alpha-c)\right)=\frac{1}{3}\cdot(\alpha+2c)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three remarks:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $P_{Cournot}=\frac{1}{3}\cdot(\alpha+2c)>c$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\because\alpha>c$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{Cournot}=\frac{2}{3}\cdot(\alpha-c)>Q_{Monopoly}=\frac{1}{2}\cdot(\alpha-c)$

The monopolist's profit maximization problem is:

\begin_inset Formula \[

\begin_layout Section
Stackelberg Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the assumptions underlying the Cournot model above was that each
 firm didn't know how much the other firm was producing.
 However, what happens if firm 2 is now able to observe how much firm 1
 produces and produces accordingly?
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In game theory, this is sequential action, and the relevant equilibrium
 concept is subgame perfect equilibrium.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Further, since firm 1 knows that firm 2 is observing its output, will firm
 1 change its output from the Cournot equilibrium identified above? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To repeat the set up from Section 1: Assume that both firms have marginal
 costs equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

, and the inverse demand function is linear: 
\begin_inset Formula $P(Q)=\alpha-Q$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=q_{1}+q_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Further assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha>c$
\end_inset

 and that firm 1 produces first and then firm 2 produces.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In equilibrium, let's assume that firm 1 produces 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 The firm 2's profit maximization problem is equal to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\max_{q_{2}}P(q_{1}^{*}+q_{2})q_{2}-cq_{2}=\max_{q_{2}}(\alpha-c-q_{1}^{*})q_{2}-q_{2}^{2}\]

\end_inset

the FOC for the above optimization problem results in:

Because firm 1 knows that firm 2 will best respond to any output

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{Stackelberg}=\frac{3}{4}\cdot(\alpha-c)>Q_{Cournot}=\frac{2}{3}\cdot(\alpha-c)>Q_{Monopoly}=\frac{1}{2}\cdot(\alpha-c)$

, which means that the equilibrium price in the Stackelberg model is less
 than that of the Cournot model.

\begin_layout Standard
In the Cournot model, we assume that firms compete on the basis of quantity
 produced.
 We can interpret this as a firm choosing its production capacity.
 If that is the case, then what is the equilibrium when firms first choose
 their capacity levels and then engage in Bertrand price competition? This
 is the question addressed by David M.

Consider a capacity constrained duopoly pricing game.
 Firm j's capacity is 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{j}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,2$
\end_inset

, and it has a constant cost per unit of output of 
\begin_inset Formula $c\geq0$
\end_inset

 up to this capacity limit.
 Assume that the market demand function 
\begin_inset Formula $x(p)$
\end_inset

 is continous and strictly decreasing at all 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $x(p)>0$

Assume that firm 2 charges

 If firm 1 charges 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}\leq p(q_{1}+q_{2})$
\end_inset

, firm 1 will sell its full capacity level 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $(p_{1}-c)q_{1}$

Notice how important the capacity constraints are.
 Unlike in our previous Bertrand example, firm 1 does

 produce goods to satisfy the entire demand.

 Therefore, there is no profitable deviation for firm 1 to charge below

\begin_layout Standard
Is there a profitable deviation for firm 1 to charge above 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}^{*}=p(q_{1}+q_{2})$
\end_inset

? Note that from the rationing scheme set out above in equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:scheme1"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:scheme2"

\end_inset

, the residual demand for firm 1 can be rewritten as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{1}(p_{1},p_{2})=\min\left\{ q_{1},\, x(p_{1})-q_{2}\right\} \]

\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $x(p_{1})-q_{2}$
\end_inset

 is the solution to firm 1's profit maximization problem:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\max_{x_{1}}\left\{ p(x_{1}+q_{2})-c\right\} x_{1}\, s.t.\, x_{1}\leq q_{1}\]

\end_inset

.
 Solving the maximization problem results in a best response function: 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}^{*}=b_{1}(q_{2})$
\end_inset

, which by assumption is greater than firm 1's capacity: 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{1}(q_{2})>q_{1}$
\end_inset

, meaning that firm 1 can't produce 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{1}(q_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, we have a corner solution to the problem, where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}^{*}=q_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}=p(q_{1}+q_{2})=p_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

 and we have contradiction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, it is optimal for firm 1 to charge 
\begin_inset Formula $p(q_{1}+q_{2})$
\end_inset

 given that firm 2 does the same.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By symmetry, the same argument applies to firm 2 and so we are at an equilibrium.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we know the result of the Bertrand price competition given capacity
 constraints, firms will now maximize profits by solving for the optimal
 capacities 
\begin_inset Formula $(q_{1}^{*},q_{2}^{*})$
\end_inset

, given prices will equal 
\begin_inset Formula $p(q_{1}+q_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 Sound familiar? It should, because this is the set up of the Cournot model.
